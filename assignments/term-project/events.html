                <p class="addPadding justify">Cycle the Continental Divide is Adventure Cycling's premier off-pavement cycling route, crisscrossing the Continental Divide north to south. This route is defined by the word "remote." Its remoteness equates with spectacular terrain and scenery. The entire route is basically dirt-road and mountain-pass riding every day. In total, it has over 200,000 feet of elevation gain. Roughly 80% of it is composed of county, Forest Service (USFS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) dirt and gravel roads. The remainder is made up of four-wheel-drive tracks and singletrack trails (10%), and paved roads (10%).

                <p class="hide justify">Cycle the Continental Divide is routed through a cross-section of the American West defined by spectacular scenery, a variety of landscapes, historic mountain towns, and boundless remote wilderness. Highlights include the Flathead Valley in Alberta, Grand Teton National Park, the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming, South Park, Boreas Pass in Colorado, Polvadera Mesa, and the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico. Colorado’s Indiana Pass, at 11,910 feet (3630 meters), is the highest point on the route. Throughout the route riders encounter wild river valleys, remote mountain wilderness, open grasslands, high desert, and towards the southern end of the route, an amazing span through the Chihuahuan Desert.</p>

We both rode nearly identical Surly Ogres, equipped with XT/SLX drivetrain and hydraulic disc brakes. We rode Velocity Blunt 35’s laced to Alfine dynamo up front and XT hubs in the rear. Our tires of choice were Maxis Ardents 2.3” set up tubeless. Fortunately we experienced zero mechanicals during the route. The only things that broke were our racks. Packlists will vary by riding style, goal completion time, and skill level, but, for what it’s worth, this is our complete list:

                <p class="justify">At Mountain Spoke, we’re always looking for ways to expand and improve the biking community. Outside of our regular work hours you might find us hosting bike clinics in our shop or putting on events around town.You’ll want to bring water, sunscreen, gloves, and dress appropriately. </p><p class="justify">Lunch will usually be provided, as well as some swag giveaways for volunteers. Tools are also be provided but feel free to bring along your favorite trail tools. Carpooling may be available.</p>
                <p class="addMarginBottom justify">Bozeman and the surrounding area has tons of great trails, but those trails maintain themselves. Trees fall, ruts form; erosion happens. Someone needs to step up and fix these things, and that’s where we come in. Working in conjunction with other local groups we organize trail days throughout the riding season to keep our trails in good condition.</p>

                    Nowhere else in the Beartooths offers the unique opportunity to see a hydroelectric dam in action, while at the same time enjoying the surrounding wilderness. Although the lake itself is not within the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, most of the trail and surrounding area is. That won’t stop you from enjoying Mystic Lake, the power company that controls the dam has had very little impact to the lake itself. Other than the dam, and a small house by the dam, the lake is in the same condition that Mother Nature left it (albeit a little bigger).

                    Located southwest of Bozeman, this trail follows South Cottonwood Creek through a dense old-growth forest with lush riparian areas and meadows, criss-crossing the creek along the way. This well-maintained trail is great for hiking, trail running, and mountain biking. The path connects to Hyalite Canyon via the History Rock trail at 6 miles and the Mount Blackmore trail at 8 miles, offering both short and full-day adventures. Choose an out-and-back at whatever distance, or drop a vehicle up Hyalite for a point-to-point hike or ride. This is a great trail on a hot day, as the frigid creek provides ongoing replenishment for hot humans and dogs alike. Directions: Take S. 19th out past Hyalite to the intersection with Cottonwood Rd. Turn left and wind through a big S turn before taking another left on Cottonwood Canyon Rd. From there, it's about 2 miles to the trailhead at the end of the road.

                    Located 12 miles south of Bozeman, or 1.5 miles north of Hyalite Reservoir, on the divide between Hyalite and Sourdough (Bozeman) creeks. Highlights: Great views of Hyalite Reservoir and surrounding mountains; 3.3 miles of fun and sometimes challenging singletrack; fairly low use. Tread: 1.4 miles gravel road; 1.4 miles paved road; 3.7 miles old logging road; 3.3 miles singletrack. From the corner of South 19th and Kagy Boulevard on the southwest edge of Bozeman, drive 6 miles south on South 19th. Turn left (south) on paved Hyalite Canyon Road (FR 62) and drive 10.2 miles (pavement ends at 10 miles) to Hyalite Reservoir (note gated Lick Creek Road on the left at 8.6 miles). At the reservoir, drive across the dam and go another 1.2 miles to Hood Creek boat ramp and picnic area on the right (about 0.6 mile past Hood Creek Campground). Go down the access road and take the first left. Day-use visitors can avoid the overnight camping fee by parking at sites 19 (by the outhouse) or 20.
